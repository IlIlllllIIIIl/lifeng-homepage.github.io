I am an undergraduate majoring in Theoretical Physics from [the School of Physics and Technology](https://physics.whu.edu.cn/en/Home.htm) at [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/), China. 

I was born in 2001 in Hunan Province, China, where I finished my elementary and high school studies. I grew up in a beautiful ancient town, Guanzhuang.


Educational Background
======
**BSc**: School of Physics and Technology, Wuhan University, China.

Research Interests
======
> **Conformal Field Theory**: My interests in conformal field theory range from the mathematical side (e.g. the *moonshine problem*) to applications in physics (*conformal bootstrap*, *celestial holography*, *AdS/CFT correspondence*, etc.)

> **Quantum Gravity**: I am interested in the theories that unify gravity and quantum fields, such as *string theory* and *induced gravity*. I am particularly interested in the situations with non-trivial tests in the presence of *black holes*.

> **Quantum Information**: By introducing the idea of *quantum entanglement* to gravitational system, we may reveal the fine structure of black holes, find possible solutions to the *information paradox* and thus give hints for quantum gravity.

My previous research experiences in those fields can be found on the [Research page](https://ilillllliiiil.github.io/lifeng-homepage.github.io/research/).
